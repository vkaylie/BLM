        <h1>BLACK LIVES MATTER</h1>

    <p>
        On May 26, 2020 four Minneapolis Police officers were involved with the killing of George Floyd.  George Floyd was a Black American in his 40s.  Floyd was supposed to be arrested for a bad check.  During the arrest of George Floyd, spectors say that George Floyd cooperated with the police.  The police forced Floyd face down onto the ground, then one of the police placed his knee to Floyd’s neck.  For eight minutes it continued like that, Floyd was gasping for air, telling the police that he could not breathe.  Yet, the police officers did nothing to help with Floyd’s situation.  Then, Floyd called for his mom and he fell silent after eight minutes of struggling.  The crowd that formed around Floyd and the officers screamed “HE’S DEAD. HE’S DEAD”

        Floyd's death and many others was the spark to the BLM 2020 Movement.  Their deaths will not be forgotten, their deaths will not be worthless.  Their deaths will lead to a change in this world.  Yet, what is the cost to achieve such change?

        <h5><b>PROTESTS & LOOTINGS</b></h5>
    <p>
        Starting on May 26 and even until June 20, protests around the US are happening.  We are protesting about how black lives matter, and the end to police brutality.  We are tired of letting this happen and their murderers get away.  We want a change in the police system.  We want an unbiased government system.  Not only have we started protesting, we have also started lootings.  The government’s response is not much of a help.  On May 29, President Trump tweeted out about the lootings.

        In my opinion, this tweet showed Trump’s opinion on this matter.  With the usage of the dots, he implies that he does not know how to control this matter.  The usage of the capitalization of thugs, implies that the people protesting are all bad people.  Only to make it worse, he tells us, thugs, that we are disrespecting Floyd’s name by looting.  Yes, I will agree that looting is a terrible way to get a message across but protesting was not exactly working either.  Yet, by not doing anything about the death of George Floyd and the other deaths, we are letting their deaths become worthless and continuing to let the system take innocent lives.

        The police started to make the protests more violent with the usage of tear gas and rubber bullets. These bullets are about half the size of an average hand.  The officers are aiming them at protester’s heads, which can be dangerous.  If you are hit with a rubber bullet in the eye, it can cause permanent blinding to one or both eyes.  Policies are also pushing protester to the ground while the protesters are kneeling.

        Trump has ordered National guards to make order within the protests.  Then on June 01, 2020, president Trump threatened to declare martial law if the protests and riots do not cease.  Then around 6:30 pm, Trump ordered the officers to clear a path through the protesters, for him to take a three minute photo op.  The federal police in riot gear fired gas canisters and used grenades containing rubber pellets to scatter largely peaceful demonstrators.  And Trump then proceeded to walk down the street to St. John Church.  He held a bible up in his right hand as he stood at the foot of the church.  Yet, the minister said that Trump has never visited this church before.

        <h5><b>PETITIONS & DONATIONS</b></h5>
    <p>
            Signing petitions and giving donations can greatly support this movement.  With the convenience of electronics, we can do this in the comfort of our homes.

         <h3><b><u>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</u></b></h3>
</head><li><ul>
    <p>
        Although it is clear to some people, others have trouble understanding the nation’s frustration.  This country was built upon slavery and this nation only felt free for the whites.  As the world grows and many of the viewpoints change, black people start to take action for a better life.  Yes, they got the 13th amendment, however white supremacys are continuing to find ways for them to rule black Americans.  This led to segregation and discrimination.  This also led to the civil right movement.  Even then, racism is still in the system.  And we are tired of it because nothing has really changed.
</p>
    <p>
        As I am a first generation American, and at first I did not understand the frustration of this matter.  But as I began to understand these matters and teach myself these events, I understand their troubles.  And it’s not only just understanding, I experienced their troubles.  I experienced racism and discrimination, although not as frequent as blacks do.  But many people experienced racism throughout their lives, so how much has changed from the civil rights movement to now? How much has changed as blacks still fear for their lives as they go out? How much has changed as kids are experiencing racism at such a young age?
